# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 1 : September 6th, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Attempted Siraj's Hidden Markov model lyrics generator, just considering frequency (not grammar / semantics)

**Thoughts** : Multi-lingual training is difficult, as they have different rules (especially Korean, where syllables are composed of 3 consonants and vowels). Might need to attempt Word2Vec to perform better.

**Link of Work:**   [Commit]()

## Day 2 : September 7th, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Got staretd with W2V on local, realized t-SNE is slow so set up env for colab

**Thoughts** : I need a gpu

## Day 3 : September 10th, 2018 

_(technically including 9th)_
 
**Today's Progress** : Tokenized text / analyzed morph / calculated word similarities with nltk, gensim, konlpy on colab. Spent some time encoding types and colab settings. 

**Thoughts** : Realized a lot more data is needed, w2v is the way, K-pop lyrics is difficult as english phrases and korean phrases are so stochastically knit together.
