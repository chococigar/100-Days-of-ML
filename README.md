# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Overview

I'm taking up [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell)'s #100DaysofMLCode Challenge.


## The 3 Rules

- Make a public pledge to code or study machine learning for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 100 days via your favorite social platform using the [#100DaysofMLCode](https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1014758160572141568) Hashtag.
- Make a public log of your work. Update it daily. Here is a GitHub example [template](https://gist.github.com/llSourcell/43194e486a92532bc343f7837b178eda). Another one is [here](https://github.com/LordSomen/100DaysOfML/blob/master/Log.md). You can also
make a blog or vlog. 
- If you see someone make a post using the #100DaysofMLCode hashtag, encourage them via a 'like', 'share', or comment!
